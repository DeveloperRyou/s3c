	SC3 is an NFT charity project that satirizes the problem of simply helping others by donating money \
	without knowing the source of use. \
	SC3 was created for the purpose of using transparency and proper donations to solve these problems, \
	not the foundation profits from NFT sales. \
	SC3 NFT presents solutions to various problems such as unstable persistence, cloning, impersonation, and fraud, \
	and aims to scale in the right direction.\
	</p>\
	<p class='common-p'>\
	As the use of opaque donations expands, distrust of donations is growing in modern society. \
	However, the SC3 Foundation aims to become a non-profit organization that grows \
	with users by capturing these anxiety factors. \
	When the target amount due to NFT sales is achieved, \
	it will support unmarried mothers and children's shelters, skipping meals, and teenagers \
	who cannot purchase health and hygiene products due to lack of financial support.\
	</p>\
	<p class='common-p'>\
	The SC3 Foundation will select users and deliver them directly to relieve anxiety by disclosing where to use, \
	disclosing the amount, and transparency, and will continue to carry out charity activities \
	in which the foundation and users participate.\
